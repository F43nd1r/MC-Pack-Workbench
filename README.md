Please see issues [#53](https://github.com/mcRPW/rpw/issues/53) and [#58](https://github.com/mcRPW/rpw/issues/58).

**Q: How to import an existing pack?**

Either add it to library so you can remix it (library menu), or create a new project (project menu) and select "From existing pack".

## Setting up MCPW for development

*If you plan to work on MCPW's source code:*

Currently MCPW is set up as an IntelliJ IDEA project, but what IDE to use is up to you.

It's a Maven project, so all libraries should be downloaded by the IDE automatically.
